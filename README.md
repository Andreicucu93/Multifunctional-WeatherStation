Why I did this:
In any season, I kept hearing on the news that "Today is the coldest/hottest day ever". 

What I wanted to do:
Make a database (the CSV) with the temperatures from the entire last year and use the values to compare the hourly LIVE temperatures from the national weather institute, via API.

What happened:
Things were pretty boring, so I used the OpenAI text API to generate a report, comparing last year's current day temp vs LIVE temp.
I made a file in which I stored instructions (ai_profiles.py) and created a database in which I stored keywords that helped improve the AI-narrator personality, making a battle between Communism and Capitalism, where one blames the other for the differences in temperature.

Don't forget to store your API key in a system variable,
Cheers.
